//
// MCSS - JavaScript Basics - Hello, World! application
//

// The Hello, World! application looks like this in JavaScript:

console.log('Hello, World!');    // Expected output: 'Hello, World!'

/*
console is a built in object of JavaScript, and it handles output to the console.

console has several functions, such as log(), error() and warn().
These functions are accessible with the . (such as console.log())
These functions are used to output log, error and warning messages.
The output is going to be whatever we write in the parentheses.

The semicolon indicates the end of the line.

Make sure to save the your files with a .js extension.

Open up your terminal (ctrl + ` or ctrl + รถ), make sure that on the top right corner
in the selection menu 'cmd' is selected, not 'powershell'.
If there is no cmd option
   1: ctrl + shift + p
   2: type 'shell'
   3: click 'Select default shell'
   4: click 'Command Prompt'
   5: close your current terminal, by clickin the trash icon (top-right)
   6: open terminl again with ctrl + ` or ctrl + รถ
Now cmd should be selected, and if you have Node.JS properly installed
you will be able to run the code, by typing:

node [filename.js] (in this case: node JavaScript_Basics\1-Helloworld.js or node 1-Helloworld.js)

Now you will see what your code did, in the terminal/console.
